# Gsearch (WoW 1.12.1)

Adds a search box directly into the default Guild UI and filters the **native roster list** by **member name** (substring match), keeping the normal Guild UI features.

## Usage

- Open the Guild window and type in the **Search:** box.
- Clear the box (or press Escape) to return to the normal roster view.


## Notes

- The guild roster updates asynchronously; if you just logged in, wait a moment for roster data to load.
